The reference system consists of six PV modules arranged at fixed angles on the roof of the Shaw Theatre at NAIT’s Main Campus, near the corner of Princess Elizabeth Avenue and 106 Street. The angles correspond to those typically used for solar installations in Edmonton. Each of the six modules is paired with a duplicate module placed at exactly the same angle. During the winter months, snow will be cleared from the left side of the modules. By pairing modules at exactly the same angles, researchers will be able to compare the effect of snow clearing versus snow cover on energy production.  The degree angle of rows are 90, 53, 45, 27, 18, 14 degree. You can find the actual picture at the ""About"" tab. In the dataset column name, 90_LEFT means the left panel and 90 degree angle and so on.  The City is not the owner of this data, it is provided to us and owned by NAIT"

These collections are from standard New Jersey light traps that are commonly used to record changes in abundance of mosquitoes before and after control campaigns and to compare seasonal and annual fluctuations in population.

Not all trap collection sites are factored into the historical averages. Some data can be incomplete due to trap failure. Some trap locations change over time. Trap collections reflect, not absolute population levels, but mosquito activity, which is influenced by changing environmental conditions (temperature, humidity, wind, etc.). The weekly averages do not include any male mosquitoes or any females of species that do not typically bite people. Each data set reflects the mosquito activity of the week previous to the collection date. To complement this dataset, there is the Rainfall Guage data which measures rainfall data in the Greater Edmonton area - https://data.edmonton.ca/Environmental-Services/Rainfall-Gauge-Results/7fus-qa4r/edit_metadata

Estimated volumes are derived from growth factors at permanent counting sites. The growth factors are applied to the most recent actual AAWDT volume at a given location.  Seasonal Adjustments Volumes are based on counts of one or two day duration (usually completed between May to June and September to October) and are adjusted to reflect an average weekday during the year. Adjustments are based on variations by time of year measured at permanent count locations that monitor traffic year round.  Year to Year Volume Changes ‐ Interpretation of Results An increase or decrease in volume does not necessarily indicate a trend for a given roadway. Some areas may record a temporary change in volume due to the reconstruction of a roadway link. Although every attempt is made to avoid counting areas while diversions are in effect, some roadway projects affect traffic patterns for a long period of time and are reflected in the counts. For example, the 2011 construction program included Scona Road, the interchange at 23 Avenue/Gateway Boulevard, widening of the Quesnell Bridge, overpasses for major links of the West Anthony Henday, and interchanges for the north Anthony Henday.

391;EPS Neighbourhood Criminal Incidents ; edmonton  ;1862;317;2017-10-26 15:00:22+00:00;  https://dashboard.edmonton.ca/d/xthe-mnvi ;"EPS Neighbourhood Criminal Incidents - This dataset provides monthly EPS-reported criminal incident count data at the neighbourhood level. Data will be updated one month following the end of a yearly quarter.   An ""incident"" is the set of connected events which usually constitute an occurrence report. Measuring by incidents is based on the Uniform Crime Reporting 2 (UCR2) survey standard developed by Statistics Canada so that all Canadian police jurisdictions have a comparable set of crime data.   The crime types used here are for EPS's 4 Property Crime and 4 Violent Crime Indicators only. Hence, not every type of property crime nor violent crime incident is shown here. Additionally, this excludes criminal incidents that fall under Other Criminal Code Violations, Federal Statute Violations, and Criminal Code Traffic Violations. The criminal code that is used here is based on the most serious violation of the incident. For example, if a break & enter occurred that involved an aggravated assault, only the aggravated assault would be counted.   It's important to note that incident-level data is a distinct measure for crime and will not match exactly with other EPS-reported statistics. There are two notable cases of this. The first is with EPS' Crime Map(http://crimemapping.edmontonpolice.ca/) which uses ""occurrence"" data. Occurrence data is more timely and immediately available, with incident-data based on occurrence data but with further revisions following UCR2 reporting rules. Secondly, EPS reporting on city-wide 4 Violent Crime Indicators is based on the number of victimizations, and since a violent criminal incident can have multiple victims, the figures reported in that manner will be higher. Counting by victimizations for violent crime is also how Statistics Canada reports crime data publicly."

Violent crime is counted based on the number of victimizations, whereas property crime is based on the number of incidents.  An ""incident"" is the set of connected events which usually constitute an occurrence report. Measuring by incidents is based on the Uniform Crime Reporting 2 (UCR2) survey standard developed Statistics Canada.  The crime types used here are for EPS's 4 Property Crime and 4 Violent Crime Indicators only. Hence, not every type of property crime or violent crime incident is shown here (e.g,. kidnapping and theft under $5,000 are excluded here). This also excludes criminal code violations that fall under Other Criminal Code Violations, Federal Statute Violations, and Criminal Code Traffic Violations.   The criminal code that is used here is based on the most serious violation of the incident. For example, if a break & enter occurred that involved an aggravated assault, only the aggravated assault would be counted. This follows the standard for how Statistics Canada reports on crime throughout Canada.  The 8 Crime Indicators here use the following UCR2 codes: Homicide = 1110, 1120, 1130 Sexual Assault = 1310, 1320, 1330 Assault = 1410, 1420, 1430, 1450, 1460, 1461, 1462, 1480 Robbery = 1610 Break & Enter = 2120, 2121, 2125 Theft over $5,000 = 2130, 2133 Theft of Vehicle = 2135 Theft from Vehicle = 2132, 2142"

Naturalization is an ecologically-based approach to landscape management used to transform highly-maintained land to a more natural condition.  Naturalized areas in Edmonton are either constructed (for example, storm water management ponds or bioswales) or converted (formerly mowed turf transformed to a naturalized area).  These converted areas may remain naturalized grass or be planted with trees and shrubs. Citizens can volunteer to plant in these areas through the Root for Trees program.

617;Ecological Footprint ; edmonton  ;266;29;2017-06-16 18:33:51+00:00;  https://dashboard.edmonton.ca/d/fm3b-s764 ;Ecological Footprint - Ecological Footprint measures the resources Edmontonians consume and the waste they produce, compared to Earth’s ability to provide these resources and absorb the waste. This measure is calculated by considering all of the biological materials consumed and all of the biological wastes generated nationally per person. The national footprint is converted to represent Edmonton’s footprint by using a combination of Edmonton-specific household expenditure data (food, shelter, transportation, goods and services, and government services) and physical energy use data. The data comes from several government sources and surveys that are conducted or published at varying time intervals. As a result, there are limitations and lags in reporting frequency and timing. Ecological footprint is one measure of  sustainability, but should not be considered an all-inclusive sustainability measure as it does not account for issues such as pollution and water consumption. An external consultant calculated results for 2006, 2012 and 2013 and extrapolated results for 2010, 2011 and 2014 based on these calculated results. As the City has limited control over Edmontonians’ consumption behaviour, Ecological Footprint is considered an indicator.

Figures provided here are based on in-house calculations with small measurement errors compared to what is produced by Statistics Canada.  The Crime Severity Index (CSI) assesses the severity of criminality by measuring both the volume of police-reported criminal incidents and weighting for more severe crime, while factoring for the level of population. The CSI is available for any city or region across Canada, and is indexed to equal 100 in Canada for the year 2006.  The Weighted Clearance Rate (WCR) measures the percentage of EPS-reported criminal incidents that are cleared by charge, or cleared by ""other"" (e.g., using the Youth Criminal Act, the accused is deceased), weighted by crime severity.  Both measures here account for all criminal code violations, which can be categorized at a high-level as: Violent Crime, Property Crime, Other Criminal Code Violations, Federal Statute Violations, and Criminal Code Traffic Violations. The counting methodology here follows that of Statistics Canada by only counting the most serious violation for a criminal incident, and counting the number of victims for violent-based offences."

Each municipality is listed along with the level of agricultural land protection found within municipal land use plans. Agricultural protection is described as either exclusive zoning for agricultural land, agriculture identified as permitted use, or no planning for agriculture.   Assessment of Agricultural Protection Municipal planning strategies and land-use by-laws were assessed to determine the level of protection being given to agricultural land in the province.  Three levels of protection have been identified through the planning document review: 1) Exclusive zoning for agricultural land meaning that agricultural land is identified and given a specific zoning with the intent of protecting agricultural land, activities and resources.  2) Agriculture identified as a permitted use in other zones (rural residential, rural resource/development,industrial etc). Many of these zones have restrictions on certain agricultural uses, such as intensive livestock operations. 3) No planning for agriculture identifies municipalities that either do not have comprehensive municipal planning strategies or do not explicitly identify agriculture or agricultural activities within their planning strategies and land use bylaws.

The license was optional, surviving records are incomplete, and 'calling the banns' remained the preferred procedure for formalizing the marriage ritual. The parallel custom of posting a Marriage Bond, in addition to taking out a license, also dates from this early period. The bond was an optional adjunct which served to indicate the absence of legal impediments to the intended marriage; an incomplete series of these bonds exists for the years 1763-1864. Mandatory civil registration of marriages began in 1864 and has continued since, although compliance was not universal throughout the province until the early 20th century."

In San Francisco, POPOS mostly appear in the Downtown office district area. Prior to 1985, developers provided POPOS under three general circumstances: voluntarily, in exchange for a density bonus, or as a condition of approval. The 1985 Downtown Plan created the first systemic requirements for developers to provide publicly accessible open space as a part of projects in C-3 Districts. The goal was to “provide in the downtown quality open space in sufficient quantity and variety to meet the needs of downtown workers, residents and visitors.” (See Planning Code Section 138 for regulations). Since then, project sponsors for residential projects may provide POPOS instead of their required open spaces in the Downtown Residential (DTR) and Eastern Neighborhoods (Section 135 of the Planning Code).

The San Francisco Plant Finder is a resource for gardeners, designers, ecologists and anyone who is interested in greening neighborhoods, enhancing our urban ecology and surviving the drought. The Plant Finder recommends appropriate habitat-building plants for sidewalks, gardens and roofs that are adapted to San Francisco's unique environment and climate.  The plants in the database include California natives and Mediterranean climate exotics. A large subset of the California natives are actually local San Francisco natives. We strongly recommend local natives since they provide the best habitat for local pollinators and other wildlife with whom they have co-evolved. San Francisco natives are the most closely adapted to the climate and environment of the San Francisco peninsula of course, and so they are the best in terms of water and soil conservation, ecosystem health, and overall sustainability.
