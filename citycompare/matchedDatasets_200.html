      <td>Ecological Footprint - Ecological Footprint measures the resources Edmontonians consume and the waste they produce, compared to Earths ability to provide these resources and absorb the waste. This measure is calculated by considering all of the biological materials consumed and all of the biological wastes generated nationally per person. The national footprint is converted to represent Edmontons footprint by using a combination of Edmonton-specific household expenditure data (food, shelter, transportation, goods and services, and government services) and physical energy use data. The data comes from several government sources and surveys that are conducted or published at varying time intervals. As a result, there are limitations and lags in reporting frequency and timing. Ecological footprint is one measure of  sustainability, but should not be considered an all-inclusive sustainability measure as it does not account for issues such as pollution and water consumption. An external consultant calculated results for 2006, 2012 and 2013 and extrapolated results for 2010, 2011 and 2014 based on these calculated results. As the City has limited control over Edmontonians consumption behaviour, Ecological Footprint is considered an indicator.</td>

Bulk-count data from multiple-resident facilities (such as group homes, transient drop-in centres, residential hotels or criminal detention centres) may be limited when personal information can not be obtained (i.e. information is not available or can not be released by the facility administration). Other Residential includes dwelling units not covered by the other categories, such as a unit attached to a non-residential structure (e.g. an apartment in a store or church) or a movable structure (e.g. recreational vehicle, tent, etc.).</td>
      <td>Parking Spaces at Off-street Parking Facilities - This dataset identifies the location and number of parking spaces at off-street parking facilities with publicly available parking in order to support good parking management policies. Data was created through the manual addition of points and attributes in a GIS system. Data originally sourced from the Registered Businesses in SF published by the SF Treasurer's office https://data.sfgov.org/Economy-and-Community/Registered-Business-Locations-San-Francisco/g8m3-pdis. Additional field work conducted in 2009-2013 to verify, correct, and augment the Treasurer's office registered businesses database. Full documentation found here: http://sfpark.org/resources/parking-census-map-april-2014/ The data is updated infrequently. SFMTA owned garage attributes are updated approximately twice a year. Note: Count of spaces found in the "RegCap" field ("regular capacity")</td>

      <td>EPS Crime Severity Index / Weighted Clearance Rate - This dataset provides EPS's Crime Severity Index and Weighted Clearance Rate statistics. Figures provided here are based on in-house calculations with small measurement errors compared to what is produced by Statistics Canada.  The Crime Severity Index (CSI) assesses the severity of criminality by measuring both the volume of police-reported criminal incidents and weighting for more severe crime, while factoring for the level of population. The CSI is available for any city or region across Canada, and is indexed to equal 100 in Canada for the year 2006.  The Weighted Clearance Rate (WCR) measures the percentage of EPS-reported criminal incidents that are cleared by charge, or cleared by "other" (e.g., using the Youth Criminal Act, the accused is deceased), weighted by crime severity.  Both measures here account for all criminal code violations, which can be categorized at a high-level as: Violent Crime, Property Crime, Other Criminal Code Violations, Federal Statute Violations, and Criminal Code Traffic Violations. The counting methodology here follows that of Statistics Canada by only counting the most serious violation for a criminal incident, and counting the number of victims for violent-based offences.</td>
      <td>Crime Statistics - Crime Severity Index - The dataset includes crime statistics at the provincial and police service levels. It is based on police reported incidents of crime reported through the Uniform Crime Reporting Survey (UCR). Statistics include the crime severity index, violent crime severity index, and non-violent crime severity index overall for provincial and police service levels. The Youth Crime Severity Index is based on the same principles as the overall Crime Severity Index, which reflects the seriousness of offences, but uses the number of youths accused instead of an incident count. Statistics included are: youth crime severity index, youth violent crime severity index and youth non-violent crime severity index for provincial level data only. This data is sourced from Statistics Canada through CANSIM.</td>

      <td>San Francisco City Survey Data 1996-2017 - The City Survey was conducted every year from 1996 to 2004, and biennially from 2005 onward. Survey methodology was changed in 2015 from a mail to a phone survey. Comparisons to previous years should be interpreted with caution. Results should be weighted using the variable finweigh in order to adjust for demographic differences between the City Survey sample and San Francisco's population. Please note that survey results were originally reported as unweighted until 2000. From 2000 onward, all City Survey results were reweighted with the exception of data from 1996 and 2011. For ease of use, finweigh has been coded with a value of one for these years. Detailed information on weighting can be found in Survey Process and Methodology section of the 2017 City Survey. A code book is also attached to this dataset under About &gt; Attachments.

      <td>Crime Statistics - Crime Severity Index - The dataset includes crime statistics at the provincial and police service levels. It is based on police reported incidents of crime reported through the Uniform Crime Reporting Survey (UCR). Statistics include the crime severity index, violent crime severity index, and non-violent crime severity index overall for provincial and police service levels. The Youth Crime Severity Index is based on the same principles as the overall Crime Severity Index, which reflects the seriousness of offences, but uses the number of youths accused instead of an incident count. Statistics included are: youth crime severity index, youth violent crime severity index and youth non-violent crime severity index for provincial level data only. This data is sourced from Statistics Canada through CANSIM.</td>
      <td>EPS Crime Severity Index / Weighted Clearance Rate - This dataset provides EPS's Crime Severity Index and Weighted Clearance Rate statistics. Figures provided here are based on in-house calculations with small measurement errors compared to what is produced by Statistics Canada.  The Crime Severity Index (CSI) assesses the severity of criminality by measuring both the volume of police-reported criminal incidents and weighting for more severe crime, while factoring for the level of population. The CSI is available for any city or region across Canada, and is indexed to equal 100 in Canada for the year 2006.  The Weighted Clearance Rate (WCR) measures the percentage of EPS-reported criminal incidents that are cleared by charge, or cleared by "other" (e.g., using the Youth Criminal Act, the accused is deceased), weighted by crime severity.  Both measures here account for all criminal code violations, which can be categorized at a high-level as: Violent Crime, Property Crime, Other Criminal Code Violations, Federal Statute Violations, and Criminal Code Traffic Violations. The counting methodology here follows that of Statistics Canada by only counting the most serious violation for a criminal incident, and counting the number of victims for violent-based offences.</td>

City officers covered by this rule generally include elected City officials, members of City boards and commissions, and City department heads.  Examples of spending that counts toward the $2,500 registration threshold include public relations, media relations, advertising, public outreach, research, investigation, reports, analysis, and studies to the extent those activities are used to solicit, request or urge other persons to communicate directly with a City officer.  Examples of spending that does not count toward the $2,500 registration threshold include: payments made to a registered contact lobbyist who directly contacts City officers; payments made to an organization for membership dues; payments made by an organization to distribute communications to its members; payments made by a news media organization to develop and distribute its publications; and payments made by a client to a representative to appear on the clients behalf in a legal proceeding before a City agency or department; salary paid by employer to employee for activities to solicit, request, or urge others to communicate directly with an officer of the City in order to influence a matter of local legislative or administrative action.  Each expenditure lobbyist must register by filing a registration form with the Ethics Commission no later than five business days after qualifying as such, and prior to making any additional payments to influence local legislative or administrative action.  Each registered expenditure lobbyist must file monthly reports with the Ethics Commission by the fifteenth day of the month following the calendar month covered by the report. For example, a report covering activity in the month of February must be filed by March 15.  Deadlines falling on a weekend or holiday are extended to the next business day.

      <td>Disclosure Report Developers of Major City Projects Filings - Effective July 26, 2014, City law impose reporting requirements on developers of certain City real estate projects with an estimated construction cost of more than $1,000,000.  Developers must file five forms with the Ethics Commission over the course of about a year disclosing donations to nonprofit organizations that have contacted City officials about their project.  The first form is due within 30 days of certification of an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) by a local agency or, if the project relies on a program EIR, within 30 days of the adoption of a final environmental determination under the California Environmental Quality Act.  Disclosure is not required for a residential development project with four or fewer dwelling units. A disclosure report must be completed and filed by the developer of any major project. A major project is a real estate development project located in the City and County of San Francisco with estimated construction costs exceeding $1,000,000 where either:The Planning Commission or any other local lead agency certifies an Environmental Impact Review (EIR) for the project under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA); or  The project relies on a program EIR and the Planning Department, Planning Commission, or any other local lead agency adopts any final environmental determination under CEQA.  (See below to determine when a final environmental determination is adopted.)A major project does not include a residential development project with four or fewer dwelling units.For purposes of this filing requirement, a developer includes the individual or entity that is the project sponsor responsible for filing a completed Environmental Evaluation Application (EEA) with the Planning Department (or other lead agency) under CEQA.  However, if an individual who signs and submits the EEA will not be responsible for obtaining the entitlements or developing the major project, the developer is instead the individual or entity that is responsible for obtaining such entitlements.A developer must use the SFEC 3500 form to file a total of five reports with the Ethics Commission with respect to each major project.  The first (or initial) report must be filed within 30 days of the date the Planning Commission or any other local lead agency certifies the EIR for that project or, for a major project relying on a program EIR, within 30 days of the date that the Planning Department, Planning Commission, or any other local lead agency adopts a final environmental determination under CEQA.1The developer must also use this form to file four subsequent quarterly reports, beginning with the quarter in which in the initial report is filed.  The due dates for the quarterly reports are:April 15 for the period starting January 1 and ending March 31;July 15 for the period starting April 1 and ending June 30;October 15 for the period starting July 1 and ending September 30; andJanuary 15 for the period starting October 1 and ending December 31.</td>

      <td>Ecological Footprint - Ecological Footprint measures the resources Edmontonians consume and the waste they produce, compared to Earths ability to provide these resources and absorb the waste. This measure is calculated by considering all of the biological materials consumed and all of the biological wastes generated nationally per person. The national footprint is converted to represent Edmontons footprint by using a combination of Edmonton-specific household expenditure data (food, shelter, transportation, goods and services, and government services) and physical energy use data. The data comes from several government sources and surveys that are conducted or published at varying time intervals. As a result, there are limitations and lags in reporting frequency and timing. Ecological footprint is one measure of  sustainability, but should not be considered an all-inclusive sustainability measure as it does not account for issues such as pollution and water consumption. An external consultant calculated results for 2006, 2012 and 2013 and extrapolated results for 2010, 2011 and 2014 based on these calculated results. As the City has limited control over Edmontonians consumption behaviour, Ecological Footprint is considered an indicator.</td>

Each expenditure lobbyist must register by filing a registration form with the Ethics Commission no later than five business days after qualifying as such, and prior to making any additional payments to influence local legislative or administrative action.  Each registered expenditure lobbyist must file monthly reports with the Ethics Commission by the fifteenth day of the month following the calendar month covered by the report.

Developers must file five forms with the Ethics Commission over the course of about a year disclosing donations to nonprofit organizations that have contacted City officials about their project.  The first form is due within 30 days of certification of an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) by a local agency or, if the project relies on a program EIR, within 30 days of the adoption of a final environmental determination under the California Environmental Quality Act.  Disclosure is not required for a residential development project with four or fewer dwelling units. A disclosure report must be completed and filed by the developer of any major project. A major project is a real estate development project located in the City and County of San Francisco with estimated construction costs exceeding $1,000,000 where either:The Planning Commission or any other local lead agency certifies an Environmental Impact Review (EIR) for the project under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA); or  The project relies on a program EIR and the Planning Department, Planning Commission, or any other local lead agency adopts any final environmental determination under CEQA.  (See below to determine when a final environmental determination is adopted.)A major project does not include a residential development project with four or fewer dwelling units.For purposes of this filing requirement, a developer includes the individual or entity that is the project sponsor responsible for filing a completed Environmental Evaluation Application (EEA) with the Planning Department (or other lead agency) under CEQA.  However, if an individual who signs and submits the EEA will not be responsible for obtaining the entitlements or developing the major project, the developer is instead the individual or entity that is responsible for obtaining such entitlements.A developer must use the SFEC 3500 form to file a total of five reports with the Ethics Commission with respect to each major project.  The first (or initial) report must be filed within 30 days of the date the Planning Commission or any other local lead agency certifies the EIR for that project or, for a major project relying on a program EIR, within 30 days of the date that the Planning Department, Planning Commission, or any other local lead agency adopts a final environmental determination under CEQA.1The developer must also use this form to file four subsequent quarterly reports, beginning with the quarter in which in the initial report is filed.  The due dates for the quarterly reports are:April 15 for the period starting January 1 and ending March 31;July 15 for the period starting April 1 and ending June 30;October 15 for the period starting July 1 and ending September 30; andJanuary 15 for the period starting October 1 and ending December 31.</td>
